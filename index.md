## Creative Projects
### <span style="color:lightgreen;">Traveled to Japan</span>  
*2022 • Solo • Limited Japanese*

- **Takeaway**: Learned the value of order and respect within society. Inspired an even greater curiosity for other cultures.

### <span style="color:lightgreen;">Dance</span>

- Worked with teams of dancers to learn choreography and perform on stage together.
- **Takeaway**: A dance performance can only be as good as the team. But, when it all clicks, it is magical.
  
### <span style="color:lightgreen;">Cosplaying</span>
*2023 • Sewing & Fitting • Wig Managing* 
- Learned how to sew and everything to do with cosplaying and use that knowledge at conventions.
- **Takeaway:** Learned I was a resourceful problem-solver by using budgeting and time-management skills to my advantage.
